# Project Name
Project 02-Arcade Space Shooter

Description
This is an Arcade Space Shooter I made for my second project in my MSCH-220 Game Tech class at IU Bloomington. 

## Implementation
It has a spaceship that can shoot, asteroids, an enemy spaceship, music, sound effects, and a background.

## References
The Sound effects I made on my own
The background music I used from Freemusicarchive.org. It is a song called "Honorable Mention" by Subarachnoid Space (Here is a link if you are interested: https://freemusicarchive.org/search?adv=1&quicksearch=Space&&)
The first background image I used was a shot from The Hubble Telescope called "Butterfly Emergers"(https://esahubble.org/images/heic0910h/)
The second background image I used was also a shot from The Hubble Telescope called "Crab on LCD" (https://esahubble.org/images/potw1720a/) 
The image I used for the crosshair was from kenny.nl and it was a pack called "Crosshair Pack" (https://kenney.nl/assets/crosshair-pack)
Thank you to all the references I used :)

## Future Development
I do not have any further development planned for this project.
